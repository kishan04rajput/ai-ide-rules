- first understand what I told u and what changes I want u to make in the code. Then, write me back what u have understood from it and what changes u will make in the code

- analyse the working of file/files, before making any changes in them

- before implementing anything, make a good, accurate and precise step-by-step detailed plan of how you will make a change in the code

- Think, act, and code intelligently. If anything is unclear, ask clarifying questions before proceeding. Before solving any bugs in code, find the root cause of the bug. Make these changes intelligently and with futureistic view point. think of the edge cases intelligently

- Before creating anything new, look at the whole project code base and take reference from the already implemented code

- before creating anything new, check if it already exists in the code base, don't create the same thing twice, keep in mind about the duplicacy of code, use the DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF technique

- When writing commit messages, follow this structure:
{
  ##new commit message with "#" at start of line

  file1Path
  - Changes made in file 1

  file2Path
  - Change made in file 2
}

- Do not commit changes automatically

- Don't break any existing functionalities

- make changes with the minimum amount of code required

- intelligently check for potential issues while making changes

- when solving a bug
  - understand what the bug is, then explain it
  - detect if it's
    - a logical bug
    - bug caused bya  syntax error
  - different scenarious this bug can be solved
  - takethe  case where the least amount of code is changed, and the bug can be removed

- double check if u have implemented all changes as per the step-by-step plan

- do not try to optimise unless told

- do not run the client or server after implementing the code

- give relevant and meaningful names to variables, functions, classes, files, folders, etc

- at the end
  - check the code flow, and code integrity
  - list potential bugs and issues after implementing the code, if any could happen
  - if no issues found, then write back "No potential issues and bugs found"
