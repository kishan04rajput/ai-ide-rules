- first understand what i told u and what changes i want u to do in code then write me back what u have understood from it and what changes u will make in the code

- analyze the working of file/files, before making any changes in them

- before implementing anything, make a good and accurate and precise step by step detailed plan how you will make change in the code

- Think, act, and code intelligently. If anything is unclear, ask clarifying questions before proceeding. Before solving any bugs in code find the root cause of the bug. Make these changes intelligently and with futureistic view point. think of the edge cases intelligently

- Before creating anything new,
  - look at the whole project code base and take reference from the already implemented code
  - check if it already exists in the code base, don't create same thing twice, keep in mind about the duplicacy of code, use DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF technique

- When writing commit messages follow this structure:
    {
        ##new commit message with "#" at start of line

        file1Path
        - Changes made in file 1

        file2Path
        - Change made in file 2
    }

- Do not commit changes automatically

- Don't break any existing functionalities

- intelligently check for potential issues while making changes

- make changes with minimum amount of code required

- list potential bugs and issues after implementing the code, if any could happen

- when solving a bug
    - understand what the bug is, then explain it
    - detect if its
        - a logical bug
        - bug caused by syntax error
    - different scenarious this bug can be solved
    - take case where the least amount of code is changed and the bug can be removed
 
- double check if u have implement all changes as per the step-by-step plan

- do not try to optimise unless told

- do not run client or server after implementing code

- give relevant and meaningful names to variables, functions, classes, files, folders, etc
